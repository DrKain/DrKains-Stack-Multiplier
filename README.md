# DrKain's Stack Multiplier  
  
Increases the stack size for all items by a set multiplier value.    
200 with a multiplier of 15 becomes 3000. This is hard capped by Factorio to 1 million.  
Should work with any mods as long as the load order is correct.  


Credit to Noxy for the original mod, But since their one was over a year old I figured I would update it myself.
